## Question 1 :
Create a function that gives a personalized greeting. This function takes two parameters: name and owner.

Use conditionals to return the proper message:

case	return
name equals owner	'Hello boss'
otherwise	'Hello guest'


## Question 2 :
There are two lists, possibly of different lengths. The first one consists of keys, the second one consists of values. Write a function createDict(keys, values) that returns a dictionary created from keys and values. If there are not enough values, the rest of keys should have a None (JS null)value. If there not enough keys, just ignore the rest of values.

Example 1:

keys = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
values = [1, 2, 3]
createDict(keys, values) # returns {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': None}


## Question 3 :
Complete the method that takes a sequence of objects with two keys each: country or state, and capital. Keys may be symbols or strings.

The method should return an array of sentences declaring the state or country and its capital.

Examples
[{'state': 'Maine', 'capital': 'Augusta'}] --> ["The capital of Maine is Augusta"]
[{'country' : 'Spain', 'capital' : 'Madrid'}] --> ["The capital of Spain is Madrid"]
[{"state" : 'Maine', 'capital': 'Augusta'}, {'country': 'Spain', "capital" : "Madrid"}] --> ["The capital of Maine is Augusta", "The capital of Spain is Madrid"]

keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3, 4]
createDict(keys, values) # returns {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3
